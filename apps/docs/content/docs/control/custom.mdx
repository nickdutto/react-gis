<Callout type="info">
  Control must extend
  [ol/control/Control](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_control_Control-Control.html)
  from OpenLayers to use this functionality.
</Callout>

The generic [useControl](../API-Reference/openlayers/control/use-control.mdx) is used to construct React components for controls.

Below is an example of how we use it to create the [ZoomControl](../API-Reference/openlayers/control/zoom-control.mdx), you can adapt it to your own Control.

#### Example

```tsx title="zoom-control.tsx"
import type { Options as OlZoomOptions } from "ol/control/Zoom";

import Zoom from "ol/control/Zoom";

import type { ControlOptions } from "./use-control";

import { useControl } from "./use-control";

export interface ZoomControlProps extends ControlOptions<OlZoomOptions> {} // [!code highlight]

export const ZoomControl = (props: ZoomControlProps) => {
  useControl<Zoom, ZoomControlProps>(Zoom, props); // [!code highlight]

  return null;
};
```

If you want correct type hints in your editor for `props` on `useControl` inferred from your `Control` you need to pass the generic types.
This is only required if you want to modify the `props` argument within the `useControl` invoke.
In the example they aren't required but are provided for verbosity/showcase.
